### 👋 Hi, I'm Semih

I'm a **third-year Software Engineering student**.  
I develop **Java-based desktop applications with database integration**,  
and I'm currently working in the field of **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision**.

During my internship, I developed a **Debit Card Management Module**  
for ATM & POS solutions using **NetBeans IDE** and **JDBC**.  
The project focused on card, customer, and account management in an enterprise-level desktop system.
